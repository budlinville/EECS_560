For this program, be aware that for matrix-equality and matrix-transposition,
matrices of sizes 5000 and 10000 will take inordinate amounts of time, and may
crash the terminal, depending on which device you run this program on

This is, in part, due to the time it takes in my implementation of filling the
matrix as randomly as possible, but also due to the inherent nature of executing
a program of complexity (n^2) with large input sizes.
